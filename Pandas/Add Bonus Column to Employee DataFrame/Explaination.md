# Explanation

The problem requires us to add a new column `bonus` to the given DataFrame `employees`. 

### Solution Approach:
1. We use the Pandas library to manipulate the DataFrame.
2. The `bonus` column is created by multiplying the values in the `salary` column by `2`.
3. The modified DataFrame with the new `bonus` column is returned as output.

### Code Breakdown:
- `employees['bonus'] = employees['salary'] * 2`
  - This creates a new column `bonus` and assigns it values that are twice the corresponding `salary` values.

### Complexity Analysis:
- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is the number of rows in the DataFrame. We are performing an element-wise multiplication which is efficient in Pandas.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), as we are modifying the existing DataFrame in place.

### Edge Cases Considered:
1. A DataFrame with only one employee.
2. A DataFrame where `salary` values are very large.
3. Ensuring the `bonus` column retains integer values.
